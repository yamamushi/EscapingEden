# Discord

Discord is used in lieu of email for communication with players, it is used for new account verification and
for resetting passwords. 

When a user registers, a verification code is sent to their discord account. This code is used to verify their account.

When a user forgets their password, a reset code is sent to their discord account. This code is used to reset their password.

A user is not allowed to log into Escaping Eden until their account has been verified. 

If a user is not in the Escaping Eden discord server, their verification code will be withheld until the bot can reach them.

If the bot is unable to verify a user within a certain time, their account code will be revoked, and they will have to
register again.

The bot is also used for user administration, such as banning and unbanning users, kicking users, issuing password resets,
and more.
