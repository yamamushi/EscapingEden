# Aleister

Aleister is intended to be an app that provides features to aid in the development of different assets for Escaping Eden.

It is currently still in the planning stages, and the urgency of working on it depends on where I am with the development
of the server components, and if any other contributors become interested in working on assets.

When complete, it should provide the following features (and more), which may actually become handy for any 
roguelike/mud that relies on ASCII escape sequences:

    * A way to draw art using text-based characters, with color and effects.
    * Saving the art to file as a normal TXT file embedded with the correct escape sequences.
    * A way to draw a map using ASCII characters, with color and effects.


Specifically for Escaping Eden, I intend on adding the following features (and more):

    * A way to design items, buildings, creatures, etc. 
    * A way way to administer the game world, using a GUI based interface..
    * A way to see live stats about the game server and world in a more friendly visual format.
