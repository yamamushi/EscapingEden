Welcome to Escaping Eden!

You are about to embark on a journey across a roleplaying world with few limits to what you can do.

That being said, Escaping Eden does have [r]ules, and it is highly recommended that you read them.

    * A letter in [b]rackets indicates it is a command that can be used on that window.
    * Some commands are universal, such as <ctrl-r> to force a refresh of the entire console.

Escaping Eden is a harsh world, and it is not without consequences. This game employs a permanent
[d]eath mechanic, that will likely bring your early characters to ruin quickly. This is to be expected,
and you are encouraged to learn from your mistakes and to try again, as Eden will reward those who
persevere and survive.
